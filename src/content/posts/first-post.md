## Hello world

This is my **initial post**, as a first post I just want to test that the markdown is working as expected.

Therefore I will try to add some markup that I might use

### A list of stuff

- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Consectetur adipiscing elit
- Sed do eiusmod tempor _incididunt_

### some code markup

Here is the code to add two numbers together

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b
}
```

If I was to write the result of `add(1, 2)` it would be `3`

### Maybe a link

My personal website is [RonB.co](https://ronb.co)

### An image

Here is an image of a puppy

## All done for now

For the time being this is my first post, I will add more later. Overall I think this is working pretty well
